## Introduction

Khemiatic Energistics draws inspiration from the ancient Greek term 'χημεία' (khēmia), meaning 'art of alloying metals,' which is the root of the modern word chemistry. By marrying this ancient wisdom with contemporary scientific breakthroughs, we aim to create a system where matter, energy, and intelligence converge to offer unparalleled capabilities.

## Features

- **Matter Transformation**: Advanced techniques for altering the physical and chemical properties of materials.
- **Energy Manipulation**: Innovative methods for harnessing and utilizing various forms of energy.
- **Intelligent Systems**: AI-driven algorithms for optimizing and controlling processes.
- **Robotic Integration**: Seamless integration with robotic systems for automation and precision.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Websockets library
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/khemiatic-energistics.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd khemiatic-energistics
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script to start the project:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. The system will initiate a series of commands to home the printer, calibrate the bed mesh, and begin random movements within the defined working area.

3. Monitor the console output for real-time updates on system status and responses.
