# Khemiatic Energistics

## Abstract

**Khemiatic Energistics** is a revolutionary project that blends the ancient art of chemistry with modern advancements in synthesis, intelligent systems, and robotics. By integrating these fields, our goal is to develop sophisticated technologies capable of transforming chemical reseach with powerful tools for innovation and control. This project aims to push the boundaries of scientific exploration and create new pathways for technological dominance.

## Introduction

Khemiatic Energistics draws inspiration from the ancient Greek term 'χημεία' (khēmia), meaning 'art of alloying metals,' which is the root of the modern word chemistry. Energistics is an ode to Applied Energistics, a Minecraft mod, which focuses on automation and integration with farms and machinery. If we can as humans can build self-driving cars, reuseable rockets, and autonomous farm systems, why couldn't we build a system to automate the entire research process. I would argue that there is no technical limitation, Its time we build it.  

This project is here to answer "What will chemistry look like in 10 years?". The invention of the Transformer Architecture by Vaswani et. al. gave way to LLMs for not only Human Languages but chemical languages alike, bringing us into the revolution of the data era. Models such as Alphafold2 saw great success and served to demonstate the capabilities of machine learning. These models are built on data that is scraped from research papers. Khemiatic Energistics will serve as an architecture to (instead of scaped data) generate new data, store it and learn from it.

**Prototyping Proof of Concept**


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Websockets library
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- Moonraker
- Klipper
- 3d Gantry System (3d printer, cnc router, liquid handler)


### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/khemiatic-energistics.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd khemiatic-energistics
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script to start the project:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. The system will initiate a series of commands to home the printer, calibrate the bed mesh, and begin random movements within the defined working area.

3. Monitor the console output for real-time updates on system status and responses.
