## Shitty Documentation 

I want to document as much as I can, but I iterate quickly and constantly break and change things. As a note to the user, 
this software is designed to interface with Moonraker API. The current setup is Modified Ender 5 S1 -> Klipper w/ Moonraker, 
Mainsail, and Crowsnest. The main software's purpose is to control and manage reactions and vials.
